1, 246, 2, 123, 3, 82, 6, 41 are the divisors of number 246. Squaring these
divisors we get: 1, 60516, 4, 15129, 9, 6724, 36, 1681. The sum of these squares
is 84100 which is 290 * 290.

**Task**

Find all integers between m and n (m and n integers with 1 <= m <= n) such that
the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square.

**Example**

Input: 1, 250
Output: [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
